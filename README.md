## 🌟 Project Summary
This end-to-end analytics project demonstrates how data from a relational database can be used to identify inefficiencies in warehouse inventory, simulate reduction strategies, and recommend structural changes such as warehouse consolidation. Power BI is used to deliver an interactive visual dashboard and business recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Explore current inventory composition and trends across four warehouses
- Determine critical KPIs: delivery time, moving stock %, utilization
- Simulate 50% to 70% inventory reduction through what-if analysis
- Recommend cost-effective operational improvements, including consolidation of underperforming warehouses

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL + Excel)
- Product counts by warehouse
- Items served per location
- % of moving stock (annual)
- Average delivery times
- Outlier and early delivery investigation
- Product categories/subcategories analysis
- Regional customer distribution

### 2. Data Visualization (Excel + Power BI)
- Excel used for quick pivots and static visuals
- Power BI used for:
  - Interactive monthly order trends
  - Orders by warehouse (volume and movement)
  - Product category contributions via treemaps
  - Warehouse-specific KPIs (delivery time, order size)
  - What-if slider for stock reduction scenarios

### 3. Targeted Insights (via Power BI and SQL)
- South and West warehouses are underutilized
- Inventory levels can be reduced by up to 70% with no service impact
- Merging South + West provides operational efficiency and reduces complexity

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation
- Consolidate the inventory of Warehouse D with Warehouse C (Power BI analysis: South + West)
- Maintain ~35K stock levels in North and East
- Use what-if simulation to validate 70% inventory reduction feasibility
- Proceed with cost-benefit validation and phased rollout of new warehouse configuration
